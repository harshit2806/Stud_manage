# Student Managemant

Welcome to the description of our web-based student application! Our application is designed to be a simple yet effective solution for managing student data.

The application allows users to input student information via a web interface. This information is then stored in a database for easy retrieval and management. To ensure smooth operation and seamless connectivity with the database, we have used the Spring Boot framework and Hibernate.

The output of the application is displayed in a user-friendly manner using the Bootstrap framework. This allows users to easily navigate and interact with the information presented on the screen. Overall, our application provides an efficient and reliable solution for managing student data.
